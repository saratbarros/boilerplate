    <p>This is Tim Burton's take on Disney's Alice in Wonderland in a dark fantasy period setting. The story follows the adventures of a young 
     girl when she first visited magical Underland. Alice Kingsleigh is now a teenager with no memory of the place - except in her dreams. 
     Her life takes a turn for the unexpected when, at a garden party for her fiance and herself, 
     she spots a certain white rabbit and tumbles down a hole after him. Reunited with her friends the Mad Hatter, 
     the Cheshire Cat and others, Alice is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. 
     She is the only one who can slay the Jabberwocky, a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes 
     Underland's inhabitants. In this situation, the Hatter and Alice fight against the Red Queen to protect the world.</p>
