    <h1>Neverwhere</h1>
    <img alt="Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman book" src="../images/neverwhere.jpg">
    <p>Published in 1997, Neil Gaiman's darkly hypnotic first novel, Neverwhere, heralded the arrival of a major talent and became a touchstone 
    of urban fantasy. It is the story of Richard Mayhew, a young London businessman with a good heart and an ordinary life, which is changed 
    forever when he discovers a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He stops to help her—an act of kindness that plunges him into a world he never 
    dreamed existed. Slipping through the cracks of reality, Richard lands in Neverwhere—a London of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, 
    murderers and angels that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth.</p>
